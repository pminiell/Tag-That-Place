# Tag-That-Place

Tag-That-Place is a MERN app I built to better understand the lifecycle of a full-stack web app that combines a Node Express backend with a react front end. 

Hosted at https://tag-that-place.herokuapp.com/ 
## Installation

Clone the repo and use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```
Run to run the app locally (this still connects to the heroku backend)
```bash
npm start
```


## Usage

```python
npm start // starts the app , but still connects to the backend hosted on heroku 
```

## Learning Outcomes
This project was a huge leap in complexity and allowed me to learn more about: 
* Node and Express
* React Hooks including custom hooks
* Deploying a single page app to Heroku 
* Database interaction with MongoDB Atlas 
* MVC design principles
* Authentication and Authorization
* File Upload and Storage 
* Using git consistently in my workflow
